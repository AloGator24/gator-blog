        The Los Angeles Lakers are the greatest NBA franchise! The Lakers have
        had the opportunity to win 16 championships. They have had multiple
        players in the Hall of Fame who are also considered some of the best to
        ever play! LA will always be a Lakers town.

        Recently moved back to LA, the Rams are looking to represent the city in
        the NFL with a brand new stadium, talented squad and a brilliant coach.
        A recent loss in Superbowl 53 has the team fired up and ready to make a
        return to bring home the Lombardi Trophy.

        The LA Dodgers have quite the history as a baseball team. They have one
        of the oldest ball parks in the MLB and some of the most legendary
        players to ever play the sport. The Dodgers are always fun to watch and
        are always getting young talent from their farm system. Recent back to
        back World Series visits have fans excited about this young team's
        potential.

        The LA Kings made hockey big in California. Just like every other sport
        in LA, the kings put on a show. Winning the Stanley Cup in 2012 and 2014
        has brought them their very first wins as a franchise. The Kings are
        looking to return to the top within the upcoming seasons and fans are
        excited to celebrate again when they do!
